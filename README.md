WOWAPI is a javascript wrapper around the World of Warcraft public API (http://blizzard.github.io/api-wow-docs/).
The Blizzard Community Platform API provides a number of resources for developers and Wow enthusiasts to gather data about their characters, guilds and arena teams.
This class leverages the usage of that API to the JS developers by wrapping all API calls in simple JS methods.

To use it, just include wowpai.js in your page.
